- **Node.js**: https://nodejs.org (v12.15 minimum)
- **Git**: https://git-scm.com
- **A GitHub account**: https://github.com/join
- **A code editor**, for example: https://aka.ms/get-vscode
- **A browser**, for example: https://www.microsoft.com/edge
- **An Azure subscription**, see below for details

## Configure your Azure account

> For the SimpleWebConf workshop, ðŸ‘‰ [click here](https://thankful-forest-09176b503.azurestaticapps.net/event/swc210622) to redeem an Azure Pass with 50$ credits.

There are different ways to get a Microsoft Azure subscription.
This account is necessary to create Azure resources for this workshop.
The resources used should all be within the limits of free tiers, still it may be possible that fees are caused by following this workshop.

To help you create your Azure account, choose the option that best match your situation:

- [I already have a subscription](#already-sub)
- [I have a MSDN/Visual Studio subscription](#vss)
- [I have an Azure Pass](#azure-pass)
- [I'm a student](#student)
- [I have nothing of these](#nothing)

### I already have an Azure subscription :id=already-sub

That's excellent news! However, it will be necessary to ensure that you have the necessary authorizations in order to create resources on this subscription.

You can now [check if everything is ready for the next step](#self-check).

### I have an _Azure Pass_ :id=azure-pass

You are taking part in an event and you were provided an _azure pass_ code?
In that case, you can use it to create a subscription.
Before starting, make sure:

- To have a Microsoft account (formerly live). You can create one on [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com),
- That this account has never been used for another Azure subscription. If you have already had a test or paying account with the same address, it will be impossible for you to use the Azure Pass. In that case, you need to create a new Microsoft account.

!> If, at any time during the registration path, your credit card information is required, it's probably that there was a mistake in the process. Ask for help of a Microsoft employee.

1. Go to [microsoftazurepass.com][azurepass] and click **Start**,

Another a few minutes of waiting, and that's it, your account is created! Take a few minutes to perform the visit and familiarize yourself with the Azure portal interface.

You will then be asked to confirm your personal information, as well as your phone number to receive a SMS validation.

Your student portal may take you directly to the Azure portal, without having any Azure subscription.
